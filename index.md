## Welcome to Design and Analysis of Operating Systems

This site layouts all of the resources for the course and helps you get everything setup for the semester.

### Virtual Machine

To get started you will need to download the **Virtual Machine** (or VM) from the [CU Foundation](https://foundation.cs.colorado.edu/vm/) website. The website will explain how to download and install the VM. The site also covers some of the issues that may pop up while trying to install, so check this first before asking for help.

You'll want the Summer 2017 Edition for this class. **Do not update/upgrade** the VM, as the first programming assignment works with the VM as deployed.

If you have trouble installing the VM then get help [here](mailto:ethan.hanner@Colorado.EDU).

### Forums

I will be teaching multiple courses this summer and have not been provided with additional help (TA's). So, inorder to ensure you receive the help you need, we will be using Piazza for discussion/questions regarding problem sets and programming assignments.
